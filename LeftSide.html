			<h1>FROM THE LEFT</h1><br>
			<p>So why would the people on the left side of this democracy demand that people on the right, specifically certain individuals be censored on social media during the election process? Well for some it is a quite simple answer. The left claims that Donald Trump did not have good intention (on some of his tweets) and in turn, invoked violence at the Capital Building. The Tweets that did Trump in are: “The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!” followed by a Tweet several minutes later, “To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th”. Trump gave a public address soon after and in his address, he stated, “I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard”. After those two Tweets and after the public address, Twitter took the Tweets down and released this statement, “After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence”. This was after months of Tweets being taken down due to a “violation” of Twitters policy and were either taken down or flagged as some content in this Tweet may be misleading.

			<h1>THE DAMAGE DONE</h1><br>
			<p>What really happened on the days leading up to Trump’s termination on Twitter and the turmoil that resulted? The signs were there for weeks. A hodgepodge of extreme and conspiratorial groups was convinced that the election was stolen. Online, they repeatedly talked about arming themselves, and violence. Considering that after Trump told his supporters to march down to the capital, things got violent to say the least. Trump did not help in mitigating the violence at the Capital Building, resulting in more than a handful of deaths, and violence that for a time was far out of control. After things got out of hand, Trump did put out a Tweet telling his supporters to stand down. But the damage had been done. The aftermath of all thins was as follows, Twitter deleted the accounts of Mr. Flynn, the former Trump advisor, the "Kraken" lawyers Ms. Powell and Mr. Wood, and Mr. Watkins. Then Mr. Trump himself.
