            Was the 2020 election the first election we saw widespread censorship?
          </a>
          <div class = "answer">
            <p>Short answer is no. Donald Trumps 2016 election was censored. Not in the same way the 2020 election was, but the Twitter and Facebook censorship has been following Trump around for half a decade. He was the first POTUS to be censored on social media, mostly due to the fact he was the first POTUS to religiously Tweet. </p>
