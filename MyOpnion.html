			<h1>MY OPINION</h1><br>
			<p>It is hard to say that the censorship of Trump during the election process is what led him to defeat in the later half of 2020, but it certainly did not help. Trump was the first President of the United States to really use social media to speak to the people of the United States, and more specifically, his supporters. Trump was able to use social media far more than he was able to give public address, so to say he was an avid Tweeter is an understatement. As a private company such as Twitter or Facebook, the owners have the right to make up the rules. If you do not like it, do not use it, no one is making you. At the same time, the rules should apply to everyone the same way. One person or one party should not receive different rules and different punishments depending on what their beliefs are, and what the beliefs of the owners of the company are. And it was evident that during the 2020 election, Twitter tended to favor the left more than the right. Not saying right or wrong, but Twitter specifically showed biased based on their political beliefs and agenda. Both sides have their opinion, and they are entitled to have them.

			<h1>SO, WHAT DO THE SOCIAL MEDIA GIANTS DO NOW?</h1><br>
			<p>In my opinion, in the future if I were the one policing the Tweets at Twitter or the posts to Facebook, I would make sure I am doing it as unbiased as possible. Maybe even making sure that the team working on policing Tweets were composed of both political parties so that everyone and everyone’s opinion could be represented equally. As far as Donald Trump’s account goes, I would keep him banned. Social media life has been a lot quieter since he was banned, and to be honest, it has been nice. Some people do not belong on social media but don’t know that. Twitter did Donald a favor.
