			<h1>THE RIGHT SIDE OF CENSORSHIP</h1><br>
			<p>Over the past couple of years, and more recently in the 2020 Presidential Election, social media was used and played a very large role in influencing voters nationwide. With Donald Trump being the Republican incumbent vs. Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden, both moved to social media to communicate to their parties and potential voters. With the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, both candidates, Trump, and Biden, were forced to run their campaign primarily online and virtually, as opposed to hosting large rallies with thousands of attendees. Although Trump still did hold several rallies, and far more than is opponent, he used social media giants Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram as a foundation for his campaign. During the 2020 election cycle, Trump single handedly put out 12,200 tweets.  Trump tweeted 5.7 times per day on average during his first half year in the White House and that had grown to 34.8 times a day on average during the second half of 2020. So as Trump was getting silenced by the social media giants, he resorted to having press conferences in The White House press conference room.

			<h1>SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?</h1><br>
			<p>Well, for Republicans, censorship occurring on Twitter and other social media outlets, was not the same for the Democratic frontrunner, Joe Biden. Simple tweets like this one from December 3rd, 2020, “Thank you to Representative Mo Brooks!”, was removed by Twitter after just 1 hour after being posted. Or this one from November 7th, 2020 removed after just being uploaded, "Lawyers Press Conference at Four Seasons, Philadelphia. 11:00 A.M”. And Twitter is fine with Biden making inherently racist comments towards minorities and people of color using technology and computers in this tweet from February 18, 2021, “It’s not they don’t know how to use it it’s just that they don’t know any better. Those people do not know about computers because they lack the resources, education, and their overall commitment in their communities. It is not that they’re dumb it’s just they don’t like to do anything. Hope this clears that up”.
